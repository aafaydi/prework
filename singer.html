            Known as the "King of Pop," Michael Jackson was a best-selling
            American singer, songwriter and dancer. As a child, Jackson became
            the lead singer of his family's popular Motown group, the Jackson
            5. He went on to a solo career of astonishing worldwide success, 
            delivering No. 1 hits from the albums Off the Wall, Thriller 
            and Bad. In his later years, Jackson was dogged by allegations 
            of child molestation. He died in 2009 at age 50 of a drug overdose 
            just before launching a comeback tour.
